following tradition here.

Hello there dear Humans!

Andi here, I'm a former but not anymore student of informatics and mathematics who has a vast interest in many things.
Among those things are currently projects in java where I randomly write something just to practice it.

You probably won't find anything interesting.
If you do, it's probably not anything I created.

Enjoy!
